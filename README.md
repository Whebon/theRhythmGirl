# Rhythm Heaven Fanmod
This mod brings the Rhythm Girl from the Rhythm Heaven series to the Spire! Playing cards in the right order is key to her rhythmic playstyle.

# Mechanics of the Rhythm Girl
__On Beat.__ Every time you play a card, you’ll gain 1 Beat. Plan ahead and cycle through your beats strategically to get the most value out of your cards.

__Measures__ are obtained by gaining enough Beats. Collect them to increase (or decrease) the power of your cards.

__Repeat__ cards multiple times. Whenever you play a card, get another copy with ethereal and exhaust instead of repeat.

__Countdown.__ Cards with Countdown don't have immediate effects, but will bring justice to your enemies in the near future.
